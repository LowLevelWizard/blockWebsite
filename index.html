        <p>Started working on webpage today. 
            The domain name has been registered, need to set it up on my personal server when I get the chance. 
            It might take a while, and I need to figure out who to set up subdomain names aswell for this page. 
            Will update asap.

            Spent a good chunk of the day working on Javascript functions for the server, using CSS to make it pretty. 
            I'm trying to make a webscraper to display the tempurature in Blacksburg, VA. 
            I tried using Python to write some code to do so, that would be converted to web assembly. 
            I encountered a snag in doing so, as I'm running Python as a virtual Environment, and the tools I am using for the conversion don't like that.
            <br>
            It might also be me trying to use Python Libraries that aren't supported by the tool, I'm not entirely sure. 
            Maybe I could keep the script I wrote, run it on my server to update a file that contains the tempurature. 
            Then, maybe I could right some sort of Javascript function that allows for it to read that file?
            Or may I could have it directly update the HTML file.
            I'll consider it further when I get back to my server.
            <br>
            The websrcraper is simple, but effective.
            I might try and have it update on the website every 5 minutes or so.
            I am considering using some delay function, assuming it wont be too resource intesive.
            <br>
            Web assembly doesn't work for my websraping, I'm going to attempt it with simpler functions.
            Maybe I can build something simple, who knows?
            <br>
            Now trying to write C to be complied to Web Assembly.
            Will continue working on it.

            Spent some time today setting up my github to work with this machine.
            I experienced issues working with the command line, but figured out a work arround.
            <br>
            Git is something I've stuggled with for some time now, I feel as though it's time to change that.
            <a href="https://github.com/LowLevelWizard">Here's</a> my personal GitHub page.

            <br>

            It took me a while, but I figured it out! 
            I think I can push from the terminal pretty easily now!
            I am going to push all my code (or maybe just most of it) ASAP.

            <br>
            Wow, today was super productive.
            I figured out git, did some more Python and Javascript coding.
            I actually don't mind Javascript now, it's pretty useful!
            
            <br>

            Thinking more about how I can get the Tempurature checking Python Script to work with the server.
            I'm going to try and set up a front/back end with it.
            Not really sure how to do it, but currently doing research on it!
            Looking into how API's work, might be best for this application.
            I also read something about a docker, but I'm not really sure what that is our how to do it.
            
            <br>
            I'm taking a break for the night, I several hours working on this, and kinda need a break.

            Hit with insominia, going to work for a bit.
            <br>
            Figuring out some C memory stuff, trying to set up a matrix multiplication program.
            Maybe I'll add a math section to my website, could prove interesting.
            Going to try and sleep now.
            <br>
            Did more work on the C stuff. 
            Continuing to make the matrix multiplication program.
            Made new function for dot product.
            <br>
            Looking into Dockers for my server. 
            Could prove to be interesting, looking into more of full stack development.

            Did some work today, prepping to go back to school.
            Then I can set up ther server, maybe even get thos page online.
            Messed arround with making a basic C server.
